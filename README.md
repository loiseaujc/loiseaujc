### Latest blog posts

**New series on simple disease modeling :** France entered its second coronavirus lock-down late October 2020.
Numerous of my students asked me how simple mathematical models could help them get a better undertanding of the current mess.
I decided to write an entire Medium series about it.

- [Disease modeling in the midst of a pandemic](https://loiseau-jc.medium.com/disease-modeling-in-the-midst-of-a-pandemic-14e06f3cd63e)

**Basics of statistics and machine learning :** This series covers some basic aspects of statistics and machine learning.
It is adapted from lecture notes I prepared for a course which eventually did not take place ðŸ˜ž.
All the posts come with some simple implementation in `python` for readers to play with.

- [Binary cross-entropy and logistic regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/binary-cross-entropy-and-logistic-regression-bf7098e75559)

**History of deep learning :** This series deals with the infancy of neural networks and deep learning.
Its aim is primarily to show how we slowly move the simple model of an artificial neuron all the way to recent deep neural networks.

- [Rosenblatt's perceptron, the first modern neural network](https://towardsdatascience.com/rosenblatts-perceptron-the-very-first-neural-network-37a3ec09038a)
- [Improving upon Rosenblatt's perceptron](https://towardsdatascience.com/improving-upon-rosenblatts-perceptron-d0517d3c5939)
